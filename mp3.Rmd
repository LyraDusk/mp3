Hi all!

Plan: Use that^^ equation to get a difficulty number for each trail, then divide them into Easy, Medium, and Hard by those numbers and create a map with those three categories color-coded.
We should be able to get trail length fairly easily
The main hangup point is getting the elevation change over the length of the trail, which we'd have to do with an intersection of the trails and the contours_3m layers
